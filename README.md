### **A browse based 2D Dice game, play aginst the computer and test your luck**
***
## Getting Started
### The final project is deployed on surge,the game will be playable in the browser.
## The rules to the dice game Pig
## Number of Players: 2 
## A player scores the sum of the two dice thrown and gradually reaches a higher score as they continue to roll.
## If a single number 1 is thrown on either die, the score for that whole turn is lost. However a double 1 counts as 25.
## The first player to 100 wins unless a player scores more subsequently in the same round. This means that everyone in the game must have the same number of turns.
